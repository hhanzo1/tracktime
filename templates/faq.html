            <p>Ready to hit the epic RC track? Our Check-In system makes it easy to connect with fellow racers and plan awesome track time.</p>
            <p>Before heading to the track with your gear, hop into your account and create a Check-In. This lets other racers know when you'll be there, making it easier for everyone to coordinate practice runs and races. Once you arrive, you're all set - no need to check in again!</p>
            <p>When you Check-In, the system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shows your session on the dashboard, so other racers can see who's hitting the track and when</li>
                <li>Send an optional push notification to other racers with your session details - perfect for organizing practice groups or impromptu races</li>
                <li>Lets you share your Check-In on Facebook, WhatsApp, or Messages to rally your RC racing crew</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Managing your track time is a breeze - edit, delete, or export your Check-Ins whenever you need to. The dashboard helps everyone coordinate their track sessions for maximum racing fun!</p>
            <p>Stay on top of your game with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A Statistics section that tracks your track time history and progress</li>
                <li>Live weather updates every 15 minutes, so you know the perfect time to run your car</li>
